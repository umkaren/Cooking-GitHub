I knew literally _nothing_ about git before this week. Now I'm starting to get the hang of it.

> This week, I have learned some of the basic commands on Git. It has been a learning curve, but I have finally figured out the following command:  
* git clone
* git checkout -b _BranchName_
* git add .
* git commit -m "message or description"
* git push
* git pull
* git status

What I learned this week is even if you think you can't learn, **DON'T** give up!
